### A Visual Story of Road Repair in Oakland 

**Research Question**

For our project, we're looking at **what parts of Oakland are most affected by road deterioration and is the cityâ€™s repaving program adequately addressing those areas?**

This overarching question will involve us addressing several other questions including: 

- Do 311 complaints of road conditions match up with the city's assessment?
- Are 311 complaints addressed faster in certain parts of the city? 
- Has the city responded to 311 complaints faster over time? 
- How did repaving shift after creation of the 3 Year Paving Program of 2019? 
- Does repavement correlate with areas of 311 complaints, road condition survey, or with certain demographic attributes? 

**Why is this important?**

While at first road condition doesn't seem like the most pressing challenge facing society, roads are a major infrastructural resource and reflection of government involvement in an area. People interact with them daily, and a poorly maintained road can damage bikes, cars, buses, and other transport vehicles. Aside from the purely tangible repercussions of street deterioration, a badly damaged road can show local government's negligence or indifference toward specific areas. Most often, communities of color and low-income communities are most likely to face government indifference, so we are seeking to find whether that is the case when it comes to Oakland's paving procedure, as well as how government response has changed over time in different neighborhoods. While mapping this data will not inherently solve discriminatory practices, it may provide insight on other issues of government negligence or encourage change.
