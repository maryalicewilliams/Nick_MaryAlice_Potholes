### A Visual Story of Road Repair in Oakland 

**Research Question**

For our project, we're looking at **what parts of Oakland are most affected by road deterioration and is the cityâ€™s repaving program adequately addressing those areas?**

This overarching question will involve us addressing several other questions including: 

- Do 311 complaints of road conditions match up with the city's assessment?
- Are 311 complaints addressed faster in certiain parts of the city? 
- Has the city responded to 311 complaints faster over time? 
- How did repaving shift after creaiton of the 3 Year Paving Program of 2019? 
- Does repavement coorelate with areas of 311 complaints, road condition survey, or with certian demographic attributes? 

**Why is this important?**

While at first road condition doesn't seem like the most pressing challenge facing society...
