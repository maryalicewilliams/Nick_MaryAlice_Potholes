### A Visual Story of Road Repair in Oakland 

**Research Question**

For our project, we're looking at **what parts of Oakland are most affected by road deterioration and is the cityâ€™s repaving program adequately addressing those areas?**

This overarching question will involve us addressing several other questions including: 

- Do 311 complaints of road conditions match up with the city's assessment?
- Are 311 complaints addressed faster in certain parts of the city? 
- Has the city responded to 311 complaints faster over time? 
- How did repaving shift after creation of the 3 Year Paving Program of 2019? 
- Does repavement correlate with areas of 311 complaints, road condition survey, or with certain demographic attributes? 

**Why is this important?**

While at first road condition doesn't seem like the most pressing challenge facing society, roads are a major infrastructural resource and reflection of government involvement in an area. People interact with them daily, and a poorly maintained road can damage bikes, cars, buses, and other transport vehicles. Aside from the purely tangible repercussions of street deterioration, a badly damaged road can show local government's negligence or indifference toward specific areas. Often, communities of color and low-income communities are most likely to face government indifference, so we are seeking to find whether that is the case when it comes to Oakland's paving procedure, as well as how government response has changed over time in different neighborhoods. While mapping this data will not inherently solve discriminatory practices, it may provide insight on other issues of government negligence or encourage change.

**Spatial and Time Scope**

City of Oakland, 2016 to Present (Oct 2021). 

**Data Sources**

Original Mapping:
- [Oakland 311 Complaint Data](https://data.oaklandca.gov/Infrastructure/Service-requests-received-by-the-Oakland-Call-Cent/quth-gb8e)
    * This file contains all data of Oakland's 311 complaint reporting system from 2009 to the present. It includes complaints that are unrelated to road condition, so we will parse all the data that pertain to pothole or road deterioration complaints. They can be organized by category description, which we will need to do to make sure we are only including the relevant information.
- 2020 Census Data
   * We are including census data for the city to visualize the Oakland's demographics by race and income. If there is a correlation between thse demographics and positive or negative road condition, we believe that we can make a strong case that demography affects the rate and frequency to which the city responds to reported issue in a given area or neighborhood.

Existing Map Data for Comparison:
- [Measure KK funding](https://oakgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=dbd0e3cbe71b4fa1abbaa33ab1b00deb)
- [Oakland Road Condition Funding](https://oakgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=d56c2b6ae597493b813be96015ae73b3)
   * We plan to use these data as part of the same structure, with the first set showing repaving completed before the 3-year repavement plan was implemented in 2019. The second dataset shows repaving that has been completed and is planned for the future under the 3-year repavement plan.
