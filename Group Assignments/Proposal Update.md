### Filling in the Gaps: Mapping Potholes in Oakland

[Link](https://github.com/maryalicewilliams/Nick_MaryAlice_Potholes/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/Assignment%201.md) to proposal 

**Roles** 
Mary: Mapping census income data, 311 pothole requests and time til request closure for 2009. 
Nick: Mapping census race data, 311 pothole requests and time til request closure for 2019.  

**Status update**

**Data update**
- Census data: We feel pretty good about our visualization of race and income data for Oakland, whcih will inform our equity spatial analysis. However we did decide that given the small size of Oakland, we might be better served by census block group data for a more granular map. 
- 311 data: The data is sizable, but not overwhelming. We're going to try and make our first maps for this data as part of this week's assignment. 
- Measure KK data: TBD if we'll use, depends on what we get with the 311 data and how long that takes. 

**Concerns** 

*Major* 
- How to overlay mutiple data types in the same map? 

*Minor*
- There are already analyses out there about this issue.
- We might not learn anything from the maps. 
- Maps might be too simplistic.
