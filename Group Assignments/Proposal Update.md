### Filling in the Gaps: Mapping Potholes in Oakland

[Link](https://github.com/maryalicewilliams/Nick_MaryAlice_Potholes/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/Assignment%201.md) to proposal 

**Roles** 
- Income Master Mary: Mapping census income data, 311 pothole requests and time til request closure for 2009. 
- Oakland Oracle Nick: Mapping census race data, 311 pothole requests and time til request closure for 2019.  

**Status update**
- We've mapped demographic data based on race and income in Oakland from the most recent 5-year ACS data, but are looking forward to mapping the data based on the actual 311 requests and adding multiple layers with the demographic data that we've already collected.
- Coding itself is going well, we runinto some speed bumps every week after we have gone through the labs, but usually we can suss out what the issue is with Google or past labs.

**Data update**
- Census data: We feel pretty good about our visualization of race and income data for Oakland, whcih will inform our equity spatial analysis. However we did decide that given the small size of Oakland, we might be better served by census block group data for a more granular map. 
- 311 data: The data is sizable, but not overwhelming. We're going to try and make our first maps for this data as part of this week's assignment. 
- Measure KK data: TBD if we'll use, depends on what we get with the 311 data and how long that takes. 

**Concerns** 

*Major* 
- How to overlay mutiple data types in the same map? 

*Minor*
- There are already analyses out there about this issue.
- We might not learn anything from the maps. 
- Maps might be too simplistic.
